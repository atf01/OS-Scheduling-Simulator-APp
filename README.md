## a project that simulates different scheduling algorithms done by Operating system to schedule the processes

### the Algorithms implemented in the projects:

- First come First serve

- priority scheduling (Preemptive and non Preemptive)

- Round Robin

- Shortest Job First (Preemptive and non Preemptive)
